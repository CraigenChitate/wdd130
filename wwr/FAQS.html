        <h3> What is the age ranges that is allowed?</h3>
        <p>This is a good trip for children of all ages. We have found, however, that children over the age of 5 seem to enjoy it more overall (And parents especially enjoy it more if their children are all over 8). 
         Surprisingly we deal with very few  children of all the ages. The areas we are rafting through are some 
        of the most beautiful in the world, and you never know what you might see around any corner. Not to mention the rapids which keep things very interesting. Each boat also comes equipped with a guide. It has been proven 
        that river guides are unable to go for very long at all without telling stories.</p>

        <h3>Is whitewater rafting safe? I don't even know how to swim! Can I still come?</h3>
        <p>As with all adventure sports, there is an inherent and assumed element of risk. To help ensure your safety, our guides are all certified in wilderness first aid and all start with at least 3 years of rafting experience. The most common injuries are sunburns and injuries that occur on land. Everyone on commercial rafting trips wears coast guard approved life vests or a personal flotation device (PFD). 
        Many non swimmers go on rafting trips and have a great time. Your guide will give you an in depth and engaging safety talk before your trip begins explaining what you should prepare
        for and do in the event of disaster.</p>

        <h3>What is included in the trip?</h3>        
        <p>We will provide all necessary camping equipment. This includes a sleeping bag, foam pad, small waterproof day bag, tent and a coat, eating utensils and camping chair.
        We provided water  during the day. Tea and hot chocolate are provided during the morning and evening hours. Soft drinks (in reasonable amounts, 2 cans per day). 
        You may purchase these items either the night before the trip, or on your way to the put-in. 3 meals per day, plus snacks</p>

        <h3>What do I need to bring?</h3>
        <p>The most effective way to plan for temperature and weather changes in the canyon is to be prepared for both hot & dry and cold & wet. <br>
        Rain jacket and rain pants- do not bring ponchos. <br>
        Quick dry shirts and shorts long sleeve cotton shirt and pants- helps keep you cooler on hot days. Button down shirts provide more sun protection on the neck. Light Weight Cotton Pant, 
        underwear and sport bras as a base layer during the day. Over the base layer, wear a pair of quick dry shorts and the shirt of your choice (polypropylene if you are cold, cotton if you are hot). 
        Two piece swim suits are convenient when changing or going to the bathroom. <br>
        Hat- large brim hat offers protection from the sun with a good quality strap. <br>
        Sunglasses with strap socks- used for hiking and to protect your feet from the sun. <br>
        Sandals or water shoes- if not used to hiking in these, bring a pair of shoes you have hiked in before. <br>
        Camper wear- Bring something comfortable to wear around camp. Cotton dresses, skirts and sarongs are all popular options. <br> 
        Sleep wear- You might choose to sleep in your camp wear. Otherwise, you might like to bring something comfortable to sleep in. <br>
        Water bottle, small day pack for hikes, moisturizing lotion, headlamp or flashlight, moleskin, waterproof sunscreen, and lip balm are all good ideas also. <br>
        Hygiene products- toothpaste, toothbrush, tissue, feminine hygiene products, extra eyeglasses or contacts, soap and shampoo, journal and pen.</p>

        <h3>What is so great about whitewater rafting anyway?</h3>
        <p>Are you kidding me? What is  <i>not</i> great about whitewater rafting?!...Let's describe a common day on the river.
        Arise in the soft light of the early morning after a night spent sleeping under a beautiful starry sky. Have a hearty warm breakfast of fresh blueberry pancakes or omelets to order, then pack your things and prepare
        for the day. The day is filled with some combination of swift water, rapids, calms, hikes, history, geology, stories, and more good food. We try to hit camp around 4 or 5. After setting up your cot you can relax with
        a good book or good company by the river, or explore around the  camp while our guides prepare your dinner...something perhaps like steak and potatoes, or grilled salmon...and dutch oven brownies...you won't forget the dutch
        oven brownies.</p>

        <h3>When do I book my trip?</h3>
        <p>If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking 2 months in advance. If you can be more flexible, 1 month in advance is usually sufficient.</p>
